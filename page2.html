        <h1>The Basics of For the King</h1>
        <p>
            <h2>The Genre</h2>
            For the King is a series of turn-based, tabletop-style, "roguelite" video games. This means that the games <ul>
                <li>resemble TTRPG such as Dungeons and Dragons, Apocalypse World, and Cyberpunk (in some ways)</li>
                <li>handle combat, exploration, etc. in sequential turns</li>
                <li>are made to be difficult, replayable, and otherwise designed for multiple runs</li>
                <li>have runs unlock things outside of the individual run to help in future runs</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h2>The Setting</h2>
            Set in the fantasy world of Fahrul, each game's stories revolve around ordinary 
            townsfolk embarking on an adventure to fight the evil forces of Chaos. The games have a lighthearted tone, making plenty of subtle jokes and references
             without detracting from the fantasy setting or the stakes of the missions. All manner of standard fantasy foes, especially the likes of goblins, 
             slimess, and the undead, can be found for the player characters to fight.
