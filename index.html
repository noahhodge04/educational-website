        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Dungeons and Dragons 5e has a fairly simple set of steps for character creation. As far as systems go, it has a decent learning curve but is not quite
            so complex as systems like Pathfinder 2e, earlier editions of D&D, or other d20 systems. The steps are as follows:
        <ol>
            <li>Concept</li>
            <li>Statistics</li>
            <li>Race (Elf, Dwarf, Human, etc.)</li>
            <li>Class</li>
            <li>Background and Personality</li>
            <li>Equipment</li>
        </ol>
            This system doesn't have much in the way of prerequisites for future character options. A number of 'feats' later on require different skills (like being strong enough to be a 'grappler'), require a particular race (being a Halfling to enhance their 'lucky' ability),
             or the ability to cast spells. This makes thinking ahead unnecessary unless you want something fairly particular. Characters will, mechanically, not feel too different from one another. However,
            the way that players roleplay (or otherwise portray) their characters is a source of individuality.
